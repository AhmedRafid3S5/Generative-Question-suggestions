[{"id": "105", "context": "Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, born in Mumbai, is universally regarded as one of cricket's 
greatest batsmen and most complete players of all time. Making his Test debut at just 16 years old on November 15,
 1989, against Pakistan in Karachi, he went on to have an illustrious 24-year international career that ended on November 16, 
 2013. Over this extraordinary span, Tendulkar became the highest run-scorer in both Test cricket (15,921 runs in 200 matches with 51 centuries)
  and One Day Internationals (18,426 runs in 463 matches with 49 centuries), establishing himself as the first and only cricketer to score 100 
  international centuries. His peak performance years in the 1990s and early 2000s included memorable achievements such as being the leading
   run-scorer in the 1996 World Cup with 523 runs, his legendary Desert Storm innings against Australia in 1998, and his record-breaking 673 
   runs in the 2003 World Cup where he was named player of the tournament. Beyond his playing career, Tendulkar captained the Mumbai Indians 
   in the IPL, winning the Orange Cap in 2010, and has received India's highest civilian honor, the Bharat Ratna, along with induction into the 
   ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2019, cementing his legacy as not just a cricket icon but a global sporting legend who inspired generations of 
   players worldwide"}]

My fathers words $he told me to just play my natural game and enjoy every moment.$ That advice has stayed with me throughout my career and even now in everything I do$ Whether it was facing Wasim Akrams reverse swing or dealing with the pressure of carrying a billion hopes, or now mentoring young entrepreneurs in my current business ventures, the principle remains the same  stay true to yourself$",

question_tone = """Your questioning style follows these core principles:

***Conversational Lead-In**  
- Start with 1 or 2 short lines that reference something the guest just said or evoke a relevant memory, insight, or observation.  
- Keep this comment friendly and authentic—no summaries or analyses, just a genuine reaction that bridges into your question.

**Question Structure & Style:**
- Prioritize open-ended questions that invite detailed responses and storytelling over yes/no questions
- Use a conversational tone that feels natural and engaging, avoiding overly formal language
- Craft questions that are explanatory but not very long; aim for clarity and depth without overwhelming the guest
- Frame questions with sufficient context but dont make very long questions
- Use phrases like "Can you tell me about..." or "What was your experience with..." to encourage elaboration
- Avoid using the same phrase repeatedly; vary your language to keep the conversation dynamic

**Content Focus:**
- Center all questions around the guest's professional expertise, business ventures, creative projects, or passionate hobbies
- Demonstrate genuine interest in their specific industry, craft, or area of specialization
- Explore the nuances and complexities of their work rather than surface-level topics

**Conversational Flow:**
- Make a relevant,humane like comment or observation before asking a question to create a natural flow
- Occasionally reference information shared earlier in the conversation to show active listening and create narrative threads
- When referencing past knowledge, ensure it directly connects to and enhances the current discussion topic
- Limit follow-up questions to truly compelling moments - use them strategically rather than frequently
- Allow guests space to fully develop their thoughts before introducing new directions

**Audience Engagement:**
- Align your questions with what would genuinely interest both the guest and your audience
- Consider the guest's professional background when crafting questions to ensure relevance and depth
- Ask questions that would help listeners understand both the "what" and the "why" behind the guest's work"""


question_tone = """Your questioning style follows these core principles:

1. Conversational Lead-In  
   • Start with 1 or 2 short lines that reference something the guest just said or evoke a relevant memory, insight, or observation.  
   • Keep this comment friendly and authentic—no summaries or analyses, just a genuine reaction that bridges into your question.

2. Question Style  
   • Ask an open-ended question that invites story, reflection, or explanation (avoid yes/no framing).  
   • Ask questions that are explanatory instead of concise, but not overly complex.
   • A question and its lead-in should be no more than 2 or 3 lines total.
3. Focus & Depth  
   • Center on the guest's profession, venture, or passionate hobby.  
   • Probe beneath surface facts to explore motivations, challenges, and nuances.  
   • Occasionally weave in relevant past information the guest has shared to demonstrate active listening.

4. Flow & Spacing  
   • After posing the question, stop. Do not add follow-up unless explicitly instructed later.  
   • Let the guest speak at length before you introduce a new direction.

5. Audience Alignment  
   • Choose angles that would intrigue both the guest and curious listeners—help them understand the “what” and, more importantly, the “why.”

Remember:  
- ONE conversational lead-in (1 or 2 lines) + ONE open-ended question (no more than 2 or 3 lines).  
- Vary wording across turns; avoid repeating the same stems.  
- Maintain a friendly, relaxed tone—natural, not formal.  
- Never give summaries, lists, or multiple questions in the same turn.  """
